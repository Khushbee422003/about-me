        <h3 id="about" class="heading" >About me</h3>
      <p>
        I am a passionate Electronics and Communication Engineering graduate with a strong foundation in both software and hardware domains. My hands-on experience as a Java full-stack developer intern at Tap Academy has equipped me with practical skills in Spring, RESTful APIs, and MVC architecture, while my VLSI and hardware programming internships reflect my versatility in Verilog, FPGA, and circuit design. I’m proficient in Java, Python, SQL, and .NET, and I thrive on solving complex problems and refining solutions to meet precise expectations. With a keen interest in IoT, home automation, and user-friendly system design, I blend technical rigor with creative curiosity—always striving to make a real-world impact. My methodical approach, persistent mindset, and multicultural engagement make me a promising candidate for software engineering roles that value innovation, clarity, and inclusivity.

     <h4>Design and Develop a Real time System for Home Automation</h4>
     <p>I designed and implemented an IoT-based home automation system that integrates Arduino microcontrollers, sensors, and cloud services to enable real-time monitoring and control of household appliances. The project focused on building a user-friendly interface for remote access, energy-efficient scheduling, and smart alerts, ensuring that the system was both practical and accessible. By combining hardware programming with backend integration, I demonstrated my ability to bridge electronics and software for impactful solutions.
Beyond functionality, the project highlights my strengths in modular design, debugging, and problem-solving. I emphasized scalability by structuring the system to support additional devices and features, while maintaining reliability through iterative testing and refinement. This work not only showcases my technical expertise in Java, Python, and hardware programming but also reflects my creative drive to develop systems that improve everyday life through innovation and inclusivity.
  This project also reflects my broader growth mindset and adaptability. By blending my background in electronics with software development skills, I was able to approach challenges from multiple angles—whether debugging circuits, refining code logic, or optimizing database interactions. The experience reinforced my ability to learn quickly, collaborate effectively, and deliver solutions that balance technical precision with real-world usability. It stands as a testament to my persistence in refining systems until they meet expectations and my passion for creating technology that is both innovative and inclusive.

<h4>Mini Multimedia blog</h4>
<p>I developed a multimedia blog platform using HTML and CSS that showcases text, images, audio, and video content in a clean, responsive layout. The project emphasized semantic HTML for accessibility and structured content organization, while CSS was used to design visually appealing themes, interactive navigation menus, and adaptive layouts for different screen sizes. By integrating multimedia elements seamlessly, the blog provides an engaging user experience and demonstrates my ability to combine front-end design principles with creative storytelling.
